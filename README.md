Sentry Minidump SDK for .NET 
===========

This is an experiment to bundle [`sentry-native`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-native) with [Google's crashpad](https://chromium.googlesource.com/crashpad/crashpad/) and distribute via NuGet with a .NET API to initialize.

Windows, macOS and Linux on x64 are the initial goals but we can add other platforms.

It allows capturing minidumps of .NET applications caused by native libraries or the .NET runtime itself.

At this time only .NET Standard 2.1 or .NET Framework 4.7 and higher are supoprted. This is due to  the current bindings generated by CppSharp. 
We can likely lower it to .NET Standard 2.0 if there's demand.  

If this is useful to you, help us in building this on [Discord, #dotnet](https://discord.gg/Ww9hbqr).

# Build from source

Requirements: 
* .NET 5 SDK
* Whatever is required to build sentry-native (depends on platform)
* Whatever is required to build CppSharp (depends on platform)

If you want to build all artifacts from source, the steps involved are:

## Init submodules

Run [setup.sh](setup.sh) on macOS or Linux or [setup.cmd](setup.cmd) on Windows
This will initialize all git submodules.

## Build native dependencies

Under [sentry-native](sentry-native):
Run [build.sh](sentry-native/build.sh) on macOS or Linux or [build.cmd](sentry-native/build.cmd).

This will build `sentry-native`, and copy the generated native library and the crashpad_handler to the relevant folder under [sentry-native/sentry-native-artifacts](sentry-native/sentry-native-artifacts). These are bundled in the NuGet package.

On Linux, make sure to install openssl lib, otherwise `crashpad` will fail to compile.
For example, on Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install libssl-dev`
